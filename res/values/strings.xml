    <string name="helptext">To make a donation to WWOZ 90.7 FM by phone, call <b>1 877 907 6999</b>.  Get Brass Passes, become a member, or find another way to support WWOZ at <b>www.wwoz.org</b>\n\nSearch playlist data by show, ordered by artist, album or title.  Or search all shows by artist, album, title or artist AND title.  When searching by text, quotes, double quotes and apostrophes should <b>never</b> be used.  For example, if you want to search for Fats Domino I\'m in love again, these search terms will both work the same:\n<b>IM IN LOVE AGAIN</b>\n<b>im in love again</b>\n&#8230;but this will NOT work:\n<b>I\'m in love again</b>\n&#8230;because it has a quote.  All search terms are searched for in exact sequence.  If you search the song title for \n<b>Im in love again</b>\n&#8230;then it will only return results with that exact word sequence.  You can choose any show on WWOZ 90.7FM and see all songs played on that show, 100 songs at a time, ordered by song title, artist or album.  Or you can search every song on all shows for a specific song title, album or artist snippet.  Or by specifying <b>both</b> a title and artist.  Search is simple but also tricky.  For example, searching by Artist for:\n<b>sisters</b>\n&#8230;will return every song with an artist value containing sisters&#8230;but it does NOT match Sister Rosetta Tharpe.  If you instead search for the non-plural:\n<b>sister</b>\n&#8230;then you will get all the sisters Pointer, Boswell, Pfister and Sister Rosetta Tharpe.  This application contains over two years of playlist data for songs played on WWOZ 90.7FM.  It is organized by show.  Generally you would select the show and find out what songs have been played during that show.  Most shows will reveal a few thousand songs.  You can get an idea of the type of music played on a particular show.  Not every song gets onto the playlist, and not every playlist entry will have correct song data. \nWhen I google for something like, \"greatest radio station in the world\", I expected to see wwoz at the top.  To me, someone who has visited New Orleans exactly one time, for a few great days, long ago, it is plainly true that WWOZ is the best radio station in the world.  I first heard about WWOZ in Madison, Wisconsin.  Madison also has a pretty good radio station, WORT.  One of the DJs for WORT mentioned WWOZ in New Orleans as one of the best.  I started listening to the online music stream at <b>www.wwoz.org</b> and found out the truth about WWOZ for myself.  The truth is that WWOZ is the best radio station in the world.  The WWOZ DJs are not playing commercials and they are not being told what music to play.  It works.  \nYeah, you will be a fan of WWOZ.  \n\nBy the way, if you Google for \n<b>\"greatest radio station in the world\"</b>\n with double quotes around the sentence, WWOZ is the first result.  As Brother Jesse might say, Amen.\nThis app and its code are free.\nAll of the data is copyright 2001 to 2014 WWOZ 90.7FM and or its licensors.  You can probably find out what is playing right now online at\n<b>www.wwoz.org/programs/playlists</b>\nMake a donation at www.wwoz.org or by calling\n1 877 907 6999.</string>
